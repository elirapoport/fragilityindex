\title{Logistic fragility function}
\usage{
logisticfragility(formula, data, covariate, niter, conf.level = 0.95,
  plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Model formula which will be evaluated by glm()}

\item{data}{Dataframe with values for model forma, passed to glm()}

\item{covariate}{Covariate name (string) whose fragility you would like to test}

\item{niter}{Number of iterations of algorithm to run}

\item{conf.level}{Significance level, set by default to 95\%}

\item{plot}{Should a histogram of results be plotted?}
}
\value{
Returns the fragility index for a single run
}
\description{
Compute the fragility of a coefficient in a logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes. Wrapper function for logisticfragilityinternal
}
\examples{
mydata <- read.csv("http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
mydata$rank <- factor(mydata$rank)
# Suggest much higher value for niter (1000+)
logisticfragility(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data = mydata, covariate="gre", niter=25)
